# RentSpace
Inspired by a struggle to easily find an art studio to rent on a temporary basis, RentSpace lets users advertise and search for art, photography, music studio and desk spaces. It was designed with simplicity in mind, providing a tool to quickly find a creative space when on the move; as well as provide a new avenue for people to advertise their own spaces to share.

## Getting Started
Clone or download the project and run the xcworkspace file. Podfiles are included but if there are any issues the required pods are listed above. 

On first launch the app will establish the users location and search for spaces within a 100 mile radius; these parameters can be adjusted byt tapping on the location displayed on the navigation bar, once a category has been selected. Spaces are ordered in distance from the user. When viewing a spaces' details, the user has various options of actions they can perform; add it to favourites, in-app message, call or email space owner, obtain directions via Apple maps.

Users can access full functionality by registering an email address and password or signing in with Facbook or Google. This will enable the user to post/advertise their own spaces. On successful post the adverts will immediately appear in the 'MySpaces' tab. By selecting a space in MySpaces, the user is able to edit or delete their advert. Chats appear in the 'Messages' tab and can be removed by swiping to delete. 

RentSpace is availabe to download from the [App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/rentspace/id1500549065#?platform=iphone)
